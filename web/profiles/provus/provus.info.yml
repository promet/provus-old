# Optional: Declare your installation profile as a distribution
# This will make the installer auto-select this installation profile.
# The distribution_name property is used in the installer and other places as
# a label for the software being installed.
distribution:
  name: Provus - By Promet Source
  # If you want your distribution to pre-select a language you can specify
  # the language code, as well. This will prevent the user from selecting
  # a language code in the user interface. While not recommended for generic
  # community distributions, this can be very useful for distributions that
  # are tailored to a language-specific audience (for example government
  # institutions in a certain country) but also site-specific installation
  # profiles. Note that this language code will also be used when installing
  # the site via Drush.
  #
  # To set your theme as the theme for the distribution installation uncomment the following:
  #
  # install:
  #   theme: my_theme
  #   # To redirect to specific URL after profile installation set your finish_url:
  #   finish_url: ?welcome=1
  langcode: en
